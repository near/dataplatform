Pros
- Isolation
- performance - close to native

Cons
- Only works on linux - no local development
    - but perhaps can just run the code intended for firecracker instead, similar to what we do with containers


Questions
- should we use kata-containers? Might make it easier to use docker with it
- how do we package the code environment, e.g. node - containers would make this easier
