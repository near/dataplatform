# Query API Node SQS Consumer on AWS using Serverless Framework
Consume indexer queue that has been populated by queryapi-mvp/queue-handler-alertexer.
`handler.js` is the entry point for the Lambda function.
`indexer.js` has the indexing logic.

### Operation and Testing
 * You can write an indexer in the Data Indexing tab of a new NEAR Social (testnet) widget here https://near-social-query-api-demo.vercel.app/#/edit/
 * Fastest indexer iteration is to use call `runFunctions` in `src/indexer.test.js` by hardcoding your functino
as the first test in that file does.  

### Deployment
`queue-handler-queryapi` is deployed with `cargo lambda deploy` to  https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions/queue-handler-queryapi
It has two env vars set: 
 * `DATABASE_URL` which needs to be set to the database url for the queryapi (alertexer based) database 
 * `AGGREGATION_QUEUE_URL` with value https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/754641474505/queryapi-dev-jobs

`indexer-js-queue-handler` is deployed with `sls deploy --stage dev` to https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-west-2#/functions/queryapi-dev-jobsWorker
 * Logs are here https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/$252Faws$252Flambda$252Fqueryapi-dev-jobsWorker
or when using the awslogs cli tool
 * AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 awslogs get /aws/lambda/queryapi-dev-indexer-runnerWorker ALL --watch;
 * AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 awslogs get /aws/lambda/queryapi-dev-startFromBlock-runnerWorker ALL --watch;


## VM2 Sandbox notes
https://www.npmjs.com/package/vm2

Supports requiring modules.
Uses `freeze` to prevent modification of the injected objects.

Notes on Features that are not in use:

`const vm = new VM({sandbox: {changeableObject: {}}});` sandbox values allow full mutability of the object

The last statement in the sandboxed code is returned. We are using a passed in object for the return value but have the
option of returning it instead.
```
const modifiedFunction = functions[key] + ';mutationsReturnValue;';
const vmResult = vm.run(modifiedFunction);
console.log(vmResult);
```

**Notes on Security Testing for Modifiability**
Indexer function contains `mutationsReturnValue['hack'] = function() {return 'bad'}`
`console.log(vmResult.hack);`
The `freeze` function is used to prevent modification of the injected objects.

## Serverless framework SQS template
Note: the producer function described below has been removed.



This template defines one function `producer` and one Lift construct - `jobs`. The producer function is triggered by `http` event type, accepts JSON payloads and sends it to a SQS queue for asynchronous processing. The SQS queue is created by the `jobs` queue construct of the Lift plugin. The queue is set up with a "dead-letter queue" (to receive failed messages) and a `worker` Lambda function that processes the SQS messages.

To learn more:

- about `http` event configuration options, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/)
- about the `queue` construct, refer to [the `queue` documentation in Lift](https://github.com/getlift/lift/blob/master/docs/queue.md)
- about the Lift plugin in general, refer to [the Lift project](https://github.com/getlift/lift)
- about SQS processing with AWS Lambda, please refer to the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html)

### Deployment
```
sls deploy --stage dev --aws-profile serverless-deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-sqs-worker-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-sqs-worker-project-dev (175s)

endpoint: POST - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/produce
functions:
  producer: aws-node-sqs-worker-project-dev-producer (167 kB)
  jobsWorker: aws-node-sqs-worker-project-dev-jobsWorker (167 kB)
jobs: https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/000000000000/aws-node-sqs-worker-project-dev-jobs
```


_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can now call the created API endpoint with `POST` request to invoke `producer` function:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://wfz6gyheai.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/produce' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"name": "John"}'
```

In response, you should see output similar to:

```bash
{"message": "Message accepted!"}
```
